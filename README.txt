INTRODUCTION, CREDITS, ETC

This is a fork of jsDot graph editor. Original project is at http://code.google.com/p/jsdot/ .

I'm not the original author, just forked it to add a few fields in properties editor,
that doesn't make sense for general audioence, but are neccesary for jsDot to be used
as a process definition editor ( https://github.com/ajuc/pefjs  ).

To load processdefinition into editor - copy it, and paste it into Tools/JSON window in the
properties Dock window. To "save" processdefinition - open the same window, and copy JSON from there.
